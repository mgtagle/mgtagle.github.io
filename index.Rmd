# Research interest
My interest is the documentation of forest fire regime in pine-oak forests using dendrochronological analysis, as well the relationship between fire and climate. Besides, I started a tree-ring research along the Cordilleran in northeast Mexico.


I work at the [faculty of Forestry Sciences](http://www.fcf.uanl.mx/) in the Department of Silviculture. 


I graduated from the University of Göttingen in Germany with a __Dr. forest__ degree in 2005. 

I am an avid [R enthusiast](https://rpubs.com/mgtagle-73) and a [Mendeley advisor](https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/marco-aurelio-gonzalez-tagle/). 

My full CV is available [here]().
